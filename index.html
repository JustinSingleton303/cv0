      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I have recently graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver
      with a degree in theoretical mathematics with a minor in Computer
      Science.  I hope to start working in the software industry soon.</p>

        <h3>Applications Developer</h3>
        <p>As a recent graduate, I am always looking to get involved in a new
           project.  I am currently completing the Udemy 2021 web developer
           bootcamp.  I am also doing some freelance work for a non-profit,
           more details to come soon!  I have experience with OO development
           in Java and am adding JavaScript to my toolbox as we speak.  I
           have learned about agile methodology have worked with issue trackers
           such as the one featured on GitHub.  I am an eager lifelong
           learner, and I can't wait for the next lesson to start!</p>

        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>Mathematics is a search for truth.  Having majored in mathematics, I have written my fair share of proofs.
           The sense of reasoning and logic that writing of those proofs has given me
           is very helpful in programming as it has given me the ability to break
           up a problem into it's component parts.</p>
